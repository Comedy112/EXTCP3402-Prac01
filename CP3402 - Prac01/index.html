        <h1>Welcome to 3D Printing R Us!</h1>

        <p>Here at 3D Printing R Us, we're obsessed with the endless possibilities of 3D printing. We want you to see all of the wonderful creations that people have concocted as a result of their wild imaginations. From things that are useful in every day life such as: small pieces of furniture (a chair maybe?), funky cooking utensils (a spoon that looks like a cartoon character), to pieces of art. Our goal is to showcase them all!</p>
        <p>We offer a variety of 3D printing related products and services. Head over to our <a href="about.html">information</a> page to learn more.</p>
