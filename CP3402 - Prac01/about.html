    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>We're a small startup business with the soul goal of doing everything and anything 3D printing related. We've been active for just over 6 months (founded on the 5th of September 2018), and for the time being all we can do is show all of our viewers as many different and unique 3D creations as possible, over on our <a href="featured.html">featured</a> page.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Although our abilities are limited for the moment, some of our notable future goals are as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>To be able to receive submissions from our viewers (via a submission page, where you will be tasked with multiple photos, as well as a brief overview and description of your submission) and then display them on our home page</li>
        <li>To be able to receive commissions regarding 3D printing, which will involve you submitting the same details via the same aforementioned method, however there will be a drop down field included in the submission form where you will specify that you are requesting a commission and not a feature as mentioned in our previous goal. This form will require more technical information (such as raw program files, and a legal consent form stating any and all legal consent requirements.) This will allow us to create and display your creations on our website, for those who have limitless imagination and ideas but no means with which to fulfil them.</li>
        <li>To allow anyone to create an account, and implement a voting system on our featured page. This will involve users with accounts to tick their favourite featured prints, and each week the prints with the most ticks will be exclusively featured on our home page. This opens up the possibility for monthly / quarterly prizes to the prints with the most ticks (although that will be much further in the future).</li>
    </ul></p>
